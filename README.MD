This repository is dedicated to clarify an array of questions in CSS as well as a toturial for some fancy animation of CSS.

It is also a `Code with James` Project, so the corresponding videos can be found in my channel in [Youtube Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrBUBSCT4ds02d4id3DBWwA/playlists).
